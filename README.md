Submitted by: Terry Wen

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Night Mode to change visuals when enabled
- [x] Calculation of bill splits among 2-4 people

## Notes

I had difficulties getting a working version of Xcode to use as I had no Mac computer of my own. I also had no iPhones/iPods to directly test the application of, and a glitch with the simulated devices where the numerical keypad would not appear on screen.
